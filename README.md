## Overview

FocusFlow is a lightweight web-based productivity app aimed at helping individuals and small teams organize their daily tasks effectively and to stay focused and productive. It provides a clear way to capture to-dos, prioritize them, track their progress, and keep everyone on the same page. By focusing on a straightforward but extendable design, FocusFlow ensures both personal productivity and small-group collaboration remain intuitive and efficient.

In FocusFlow, tasks are the central element. Each task has attributes such as a title, description, and status (e.g., “Open,” “In Progress,” “Done”). Additional information, like due dates and priority levels, can also be specified. FocusFlow offers optional user-assignment features, where a single user or multiple users may be associated with a task, making it easy to clarify responsibilities within a team.

Alongside everyday task management, FocusFlow accommodates more advanced needs through optional enhancements. For instance, tasks may be grouped into categories or projects, helping users structure workloads across different domains. For even more granularity, FocusFlow also supports labels or tags, letting users refine the organization of tasks without complicated overhead.

Beyond basic task creation and editing, FocusFlow highlights a simple but robust approach to collaboration. Team members can leave brief comments on tasks, and automated notifications (e.g. via email) remind users of upcoming deadlines or newly assigned responsibilities. Administrators can manage user accounts—controlling roles such as “Regular User” or “Project Admin” if your team requires more advanced access management.

Above all, FocusFlow aims to streamline daily workflows. By avoiding bloated functionality and concentrating on clarity, the system helps individuals and small teams coordinate quickly, remain flexible, and adapt as new priorities emerge. Whether it’s for a semester project, a small dev team, or personal to-do organization, FocusFlow stands as a practical example application that demonstrates how to build, maintain, and test a modern 3-tier web-based solution.
